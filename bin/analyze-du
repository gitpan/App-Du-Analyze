=head1 NAME

analyze-du - analyze the output of C<\du .>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This analyses the output of C<\du .> looking for directories with a certain
prefix, a certain depth and possibly sorting the output by size. It aims to
aid in finding the most space-consuming components in the directory tree
on the disk.

One can specify the filename as the last argument, or using the environment
variable C<ANALYZE_DU_INPUT_FN> . If none of them are specified, it defaults
to using the standard input (STDIN).
